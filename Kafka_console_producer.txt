1) To produce messages in topic, below command is used
kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic

after executing above command , we are good to enter messages
>Hello this is Kafka.
>This is my 1st message.

2)
kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --producer-property acks=all

3)Create a topic on the fly and start producing to it
kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic third_topic
Note: This gives error, not able to map to broker.
So its recommended to create a topic first and then try to produde it.
